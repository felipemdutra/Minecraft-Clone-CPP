This is a Minecraft Clone I am developing using OpenGL.
The Project aims to recreate core features of Minecraft.

It's still in development, so I plan to add more features.

Technologies used:
- C++
- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLEW
- glm ( math and transformations )

Features:
- Basic block rendering and texturing
- First-person camera movement
- Chunk system for large worlds ( in development )

Planned Features:
- Random terrain generation
- Block interactions ( placing, breaking )
- Player movement and collision
